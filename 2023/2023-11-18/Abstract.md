There’s an ant colony in your kitchen, and you might have not noticed that. [shocked reaction] In this session, we will explore the power of Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) in solving mazes. We’ll delve deep into the fascinating world of Nature-Inspired Computing by applying the popular metaheuristic algorithm that mimics the foraging behavior of ants, to labyrinths all around the world. 

Topics included: Nature-Inspired Computing / Evolutionary Algorithms / Ant Colony Optimization / Mazes / Ants 🐜
